| Lab 2 on time delivery   | Implementation of a Nim agent optimised through an Evolutionary Strategy.  A total of three solutions have been tried, a weighted rule optimisation agent, a state predicting agent through evolutionary-strategy-optimised logistic regressor and a state predicting agent through evolutionary-strategy-optimised neural network. The solution yielding the best results was a state predicting nim agent though a evolutionary-strategy-optimised logistic classifier. | [Link to Lab 2](https://github.com/florentin1304/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Laboratories/Lab2) |

| Lab 2 class presentation  | During the lecture of 23/11/2023 I presented the logistic-regressor nim agent, explaining thetheory behind the solution and the methods of its implementation                             |         -          |

| Lab 9 on time delivery   | For this laboratory an in depth benchmark of genetic algorithms variations was done. Furthermore another benchmark was done for the multi-population strategies (islands) and some of their variations (Valhalla Island, Segregation Islands). Finally one other variation was proposed (Expert Islands) where each population was responsible of a sub-part of the solution, achieving top results for the problem proposed. The laboratory was done in collaboration with [Luca&nbsp;Catalano](https://github.com/LucaCatalano13/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main) and [Claudio Savelli](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli/computational-intelligence-PoliTO) | [Link to Lab 9](https://github.com/florentin1304/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Laboratories/Lab9) |

| Lab 10 on time delivery   | The objective of this laboratory was to create a TicTacToe player agent using some reinforcement learning algorithm. The Q-Learning algorithm was used. The training was done both against a random player (ensuring exploration from the opponent side) and an informed player, that always played the optimal move if possible (using a magic square heuristic). The agent was then tested against these two and other versions of the same trained agent. | [Link to Lab 10](https://github.com/florentin1304/computational-intelligence/tree/main/Laboratories/Lab10) |

### Disclaimer

Even though most of the code presented in this repo has been produced by the authors, or sometimes by the Professor during lectures, some pieces have been eventually developed through the help provided by several discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and by AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (version 3.5). These have represented a great starting point for creating our own custom solutions!
