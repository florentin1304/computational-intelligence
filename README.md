| Lab 1                    | Implementation of the A* search algorithm for the set covering problem by proposing new heuristic and cost functions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Link to Lab 1]() |
| Halloween challange      | Took part in the Halloween Challenge. New steady algorithm for the set covering problem proposed based on binary search and taboo search for exhaustive local optimum search                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [Link to Halloween Challange]() |
| Lab 2                    | Implementation of a Nim agent optimised through an Evolutionary Strategy.  A total of three solutions have been tried, a weighted rule optimisation agent, a state predicting agent through evolutionary-strategy-optimised logistic regressor and a state predicting agent through evolutionary-strategy-optimised neural network. The solution yielding the best results was a state predicting nim agent though a evolutionary-strategy-optimised logistic classifier. | [Link to Lab 2]() |
| Lab 2 class presentation | During the lecture of 23/11/2023 I presented the logistic-regressor nim agent, explaining thetheory behind the solution and the methods of its implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                   |

### Disclaimer

Even though most of the code presented in this repo has been produced by the authors, or sometimes by the Professor during lectures, some pieces have been eventually developed through the help provided by several discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and by AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (version 3.5). These have represented a great starting point for creating our own custom solutions!
